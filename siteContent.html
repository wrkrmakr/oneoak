                                <p>With over 11 years in the construction industry, Rahul Faria has carved out a reputation for always delivering projects in a timely and cost conscious manner, with a emphasis on quality and safety.</p>
                                <p>While obtaining a Degree in Civil Engineering at the University of Waterloo, he was able to have considerable experience in a variety of construction related fields until he worked at Bird Construction. Starting out as an Assistant Estimator as a student, and further building on that with York Contracting Ltd. by eventually leading the estimating team as a Chief Estimator and Senior Project Manager, he was able to establish the knowledge of the ‘backbone’ of the construction process by establishing costs for the various facets of a project, while also maintaining client expectations and managing the very projects he estimated.</p>
                                <p>After numerous years and gaining considerable experience, he decided to create a firm of his own and bring the culture of superior standards, safety, collaborative working environment while delivering a project in a timely manner, and more importantly, with impeccable quality.</p>
                                <p>One Oak Construction, or ‘One of a Kind’ Construction, is the culmination of that vision where clients, be it commercial or residential, are brought into a collaborative environment to bring a specific project to fruition.</p>
                                <p>We achieve these safety standards by providing every representative of One Oak Inc. the adequate industry training and performing random on-site safety inspections. These inspections are carried out by a third party certified safety consultant to ensure not just that all the safety rules and regulations are being followed, but also a safe working environment for all the on-site contractors.</p>
